## About Me

Currently I am an undergraduate student at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT). In September 2023, I was admitted to study for a graduate degree at [PALM](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/) lab, Department of Computer Science, Southeast University (SEU) under the supervision of Prof. [Xin Geng](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0102/c23024a257021/page.psp) without entrance examination.

## Research Interests
I have wide interest on AI, especially machine learning and deep learning. For now, I'll focus on the following topics:

- **Large Language Model:** model alignment, model compression
- **Reinforcement Learning:** offline RL, model-based RL
